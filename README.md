### For more information on why I made this mod, [here is the link to the issue.](https://github.com/SolipIngen/minecraft.progressivearchery/issues/83)

If you are interested in this mod for a version of Minecraft other than 1.21.1, post an issue and I will likely make it :)

In the words of Solipingen,

May all your aims be true.
